**PROMPT PARA CAPA**

Create a square podcast cover (3000x3000 px) for a show called “Estamparadoxa”, with the subtitle “Caos criativo sob demanda”.

Visual style: vibrant, alternative streetwear aesthetic mixed with urban dystopian art, collage elements, glitch textures, and graffiti/spray paint motifs.

Incorporate bold typography with high legibility for both the title and subtitle. The layout should feel creatively chaotic but visually balanced — like a controlled explosion of ideas.

Include subtle references to t-shirts or print-on-demand culture (such as print icons, garment tags, abstract shirt outlines, or fabric textures).

Use contrasting and vivid colors — think acid green, deep purple, black, and white, with street textures like concrete, grunge, or pixel noise.

Style: digital art, urban collage, design-forward, expressive, eye-catching at thumbnail size.

Do not include any realistic faces or photographic elements — focus on graphic composition and street-inspired design.
